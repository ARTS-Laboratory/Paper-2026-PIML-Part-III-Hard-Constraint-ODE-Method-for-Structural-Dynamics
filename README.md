# Physics Informed Machine Learning Part III: Hard-Constraint ODE Method for Structural Dynamics
Paper 2026 IMAC PIML

Tutorial codes demonstrating a variety of PIML methods.
Comparison methods:
1. Pure physics
1. Pure NN

PIML methods:
1. Indirect measurement

## Files too large for GitHub
This repo has some files too large for GitHub. The workaround it to generate these files on your own. 
1. In `physics based modeling`, run `to_numpy.py` to convert .csv files to .npy. This will save `.npz` versions of data in the `PIML examples/data/`.

We may try to get these to work with LFS in the future. For now, you can find the files [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/p7u6dwy1t8o83hk3dgnlz/AO3S344MKnTcE55aHe9J2Gs?rlkey=6aor3ivq2wrm9j06h62nnedgn&dl=0).

The files are:
1. PIML examples/data/v5/no_friction.npy
1. PIML examples/data/v5/with_friction.npy
1. PIML examples/model_predictions/pure_physics/k_pred.npy (May or may not be needed. )


## Version control
Tensorflow 2.10.0 (Nile) and 2.13.0 (Austin) were used to develop this code.
